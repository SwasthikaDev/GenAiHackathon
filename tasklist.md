- [ ] Budget breakdown with charts (owner: frontend-dev) [1h]
- [ ] Calendar/timeline view (owner: frontend-dev) [1.5h]
- [ ] PWA features (owner: frontend-dev) [45min]
- [ ] Better styling and UX (owner: frontend-dev) [1h]
- [ ] Advanced search (owner: backend-dev) [1h]

### Notes
- City seeding removed from workflow; use Places search + cities/ensure.

### Risk Mitigation & Contingency Plans
- **If backend dev falls behind**: Simplify models, use Django admin for some features initially
- **If frontend dev falls behind**: Use basic HTML forms instead of rich components
- **If deployment issues**: Have local demo ready with Docker Compose
- **If search is complex**: Use simple string matching instead of full-text search
- **Critical path**: Auth ‚Üí Trips CRUD ‚Üí Basic Itinerary ‚Üí Public Share

### Team Roles
- **backend-dev**: Python/Django expert
- **frontend-dev**: React/Next.js expert  
- **devops**: Deployment and CI/CD
- **full-stack**: Can help either side
- **team-lead**: Coordination and project setup

### Hourly Check-ins (5min each)
- **Hour 2**: Setup complete? Any blockers?
- **Hour 6**: Scaffolds working? Auth flow ready?  
- **Hour 10**: Trips CRUD working? Ready for itinerary?
- **Hour 12**: Basic itinerary done? Start sharing feature?
- **Hour 16**: Public sharing working? Ready to deploy?
- **Hour 17**: Deployment status? Demo prep?

**EMERGENCY CUTS if behind schedule:**
1. Skip user signup - just use hardcoded users
2. Skip authentication - public app only  
3. Skip activities - just cities and dates
4. Skip database - use JSON files
5. Skip deployment - local demo only

Notes
- Keep this list updated every 2 hours. Move completed tasks to bottom with [x].
- Total estimated time: ~16 hours (critical path only)
